          <h1>Who Are They?</h1>
          <p>
            AM (Alana) DeVito is a non-binary, Montreal-based, composer, sound
            designer, musician, and interdisciplinary artist. Their career as a
            touring and studio musician spans well over 10 years, multiple
            countries and numerous instruments, and has now expanded into new
            forms and new collaborations in digital arts, film scoring, and art
            installations. In creative A/V installations, compositions and
            performances, the weaving of ‘virtual kinetic’ soundscapes through
            vibrant, textural worlds take center stage while unique, sonic
            architecture project sweeping narratives. Creative computing
            intertwines with immersive environments while blurring the line
            between the aural and visual sonic space.

          <h2>But there was a time before.</h2>

          <p>
            Before returning to school and relocating to Montreal in 2018, Am
            performed under the moniker, Bobbypin, recording and playing in
            Berlin and touring around Europe. Before that, they played bass and
            toured North America and Europe in 2015 with the Montreal band,
            T0PS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Am, originally from Burlington, Ontario, moved to Toronto in 2003 to
            start their first band, Machetes, an Iggy pop-meets-Siousxie Sioux
            influenced sludge punk band managed by the Cure's keyboardist, Roger
            O'Donnell.
