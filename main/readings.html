          <h2>Week 4: the GNU Manifesto</h2>
          <p></p>
          <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html"
            >Richard Stallman, The GNU Manifesto</a
          >
          <p></p>

          <p>
            First of all, I feel that this manifesto is missing the point of its
            overall goal. By taking the path of acute obsession over what ‘free
            software’ means and doesn’t mean, it does what it strives to avoid;
            confuse the interested party. While the term ‘open source’ may not
            appeal with the patrons of GNU, it loses an important fact about
            marketing a movement; ease of inspiration. ‘Open source’ is
            currently welcoming, and easily understood. Rambling on with a
            diatribe about the different meanings of ‘free’ and the applicable
            context in this stadium loses traction while trying to mobilize the
            audience. Then again, when the term ‘open source’ was first utilized
            in its present context, they probably took multiple pages to explain
            it as well… (and in fact is the case as mentioned on the Philosophy
            page of the site, where it also mentions how the argument for the
            term “‘open source’ pays no attention to right and wrong, only to
            popularity and success…”).
          </p>
          <p>
            As I continued reading, I came to understand the writer’s obsession
            with the semantics of ‘free software’. It is a necessary confusion.
            Mainly from the roots of developing the GNU system itself. Removing
            the shackles of capitalistic control means fully committing to the
            movement of fully accessible, public software. The fact that
            information accessibility and software development must be a public
            right. Hence, yes, ‘Free Software’ is the larger, more meaningful
            term than ‘open software’. I stand corrected.
          </p>
          <p>
            About mid-way through the manifesto, one thing is clear; the goal is
            to promote the philosophy first and GNU is the embodiment of this
            philosophy. Whereas GNU may not be realistic for all companies, as
            they require the ‘person-power’ of tech support services, there
            should be an alternative for those who can take on that work
            themselves (or pay-as-you-go support services). At its core, it is
            more about the accessibility of software than the reach or promotion
            of GNU itself. This is emphasized in the manner that ‘marketing and
            distribution’ is discussed – ‘word of mouth’ is the preferrable
            marketing or PR tactic – and understandably so – in a not-for-profit
            system it not only spreads the product but relies on the method to
            build, bridge and sustain a community. For profit systems have to
            pay for this find of strength and longevity. To repurpose a
            sentiment in the manifesto, “When there is a deliberate choice to
            restrict, the harmful consequences are deliberate destruction”.
          </p>

          <p></p>

          <p class="pull_quote">
            “When there is a deliberate choice to restrict, the harmful
            consequences are deliberate destruction”.
          </p>

          <p>
            A thought comes to mind. Most of the programmers at the level that
            can create, manage and sustain software at this level are probably
            (quite) well paid in other facets of their career. Those doing this
            ‘free’ work on top of their personal economy are sharing the wealth
            in a societally productive manner – something that those in places
            of privilege should do in a society – build and sustain communities
            and accessibilities for all – to promote the equal advancement and
            sustainability of a community. The creative community promotes this
            often.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the final paragraph the goal is clearer. Software development and
            redistribution could be a part of an integrated future that
            prioritizes people and accessibility over profit. And that, I
            support.

            Internet (net.art) created a medium and a community to revive the
            art scene that imploded through the decimation by commercial
            exploitation and consumerism of pop art esthetics. It had become
            elite and controlled by the upper-yuppy-class. The gatekeepers with
            a strict members only-list. Exactly what the communities strive to
            destroy in the early years of any creative class.
          </p>
          <p>
            The open format, accessibility and anonymity created a new spark for
            creativity and the ‘methods, production and distribution’ allowed by
            the new art form became the stamp and the aesthetic of the new media
            model. JoDI.org’s work is intriguing and engaging in the ways in
            which it ‘stumps even the most computer literate’. The idea that you
            are constantly questioning, “What for and why?’ is such an integral
            but simple question that, really should be injected into many more
            artforms than it is (and it is). The catch phrase personifying the
            existential dread of society and culture through a piece of
            interactive web art.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was introduced to the VNS Matrix and the cyberfeminism movement
            that included the Australian collective a couple of years ago when
            researching new forms of feminist art. It is a concept that connects
            with me closely because of their ideas of the power in the
            genderless connected with feminism and the ways in which this
            approach to gender scrambles the ‘mind of the BIG DADDY MAINFRAME’.
            It. Does. Not. COM.PUTE> It is the power in the cunt – the embodied
            and the quintessence. I interpreter this as the cunt can be a
            female, trans or a genderless’s embodied power. Much of this is
            connected to the Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway – the dismissal
            of the shackles that separate human and machine and human and
            animal. The strength in the unification of these entities and what
            they mean in the technological overworld.
          </p>

            'The strength in the unification of these entities and what they
            mean in the technological overworld.'
          </p>

          <p>
            Moving to the article, The New World Of Net.Art , I am inspired by
            Christiane Paul’s comment of how NetArt has evolved to take on
            different manifestations, moving from the virtual world, to
            standalone computer applications on to out-of-the-box, IRL
            installations. It is something that I am striving to embody in my
            own creative practice. The arm that reaches out from the virtual
            world to connect with the humanity of the physical world. Funnily
            enough, I too have, ‘a bit of that ADD mentality’.
          </p>
          <p>
            While reading about Jon Rafman being included in this article, it
            was an interesting thought that the very medium that made this
            web-artist famous brought him crashing down – he has been accused of
            sexual misconduct by a number of women in the Montreal community,
            and as of the past year or so has been dropped by some of his
            gallery representatives. Highlighting one of the strengths of this
            medium as opposed to others – there is now nowhere to hide your
            abuse in the circuits of the internet. The community of whispers
            that used to protect many women in a creative community is now
            screamed from the platforms of the digital realm. It is poetic to
            think that the world from where his success was birthed also tore
            him down.

          ‘The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US
          would Mess it Up’ -and rightly so. As we know now, there is an
          onslaught of dangerous misinformation and corporate monopolization of
          information on the mainly American-owned World Wide Web of today -
          although, to be fair, any for profit system spawned from the recesses
          of capitalistic greed would produce a close replication, no matter how
          ‘politely Canadian’ it may be. However, it is interesting to muse
          about another alternate reality where Canada has their own internet,
          and how those distinctly non-Americanisms of the Canadian ideations
          may have produced a slightly different network of media and open form
          information. It’s nice to think that a Canadian government run
          internet may not sell the information of its people to corporations,
          while using the behavioral and psychological intersections of
          addiction to fuse our brains to the social media mutant that plagues
          much of society today. I have some faith in Canada but maybe not that
          much.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for Counterculture to Cyberculture, the imagery of the computer
          nerds crossing over with the hippies and the ‘freaks’ - as so many
          people from that era called themselves if they were the outsiders, but
          not necessarily hippies- is not a foreign concept to me as it is
          similar to the history of electroacoustic and early electronic music
          (I am majoring in Electroacoustic studies). While the computer systems
          of those days lived exclusively in the basements of the higher
          education -where ‘cyber-futurists’ would interact with complex systems
          while contemplating the positive impact it could have on art and
          culture - the same was happening with giant synthesizers and
          oscillators ‘next door’. There was always an underground approach to
          ‘higher technologies’ throughout the ages. Even though, to the
          majority of the public, computers and technology was originally
          thought of for the elite, in actuality it was the counterculturalists
          who were the first to manifest the push for the open access
          information-super highway that was made possible by the internet. It’s
          ingrained into its history, and thus branded in every circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘You don't have to leave industrial society, but you don't have to
          accept it the way it is…’. This quote from From Counterculture to
          Cyberculture rings particularly true to me right now, with the very
          polarized group of radicalized friends; some wishing to leave society
          and farm off-the-grid while others argue the importance to stay
          engaged in society and fight for change. The difficulty of industry
          and technology in the past and present is the control that capitalism
          has on weaponizing those bodies for their needs of profit. This huge
          burdensome cloud over the positive advancements that technology and
          computers have afforded many people - more particularly to those who
          may not have otherwise been afforded the luxury of information and
          world-wide reaching discourse between different communities (referring
          to the ways in which social media has connected people, and empowered
          positive change, while putting the power of free education back into
          the hands of the people). The essence of ‘open source’ as a
          countercultural concept cannot be understated. Although the ideals
          prophesied in the early internet age have been diluted and over taken
          by the darkness of mis-information and lack of trust in the media -
          and even science its self - there still lives the power for many
          avenues to promote shared education and technological opportunities
          that may not have been afforded if those ideals were not present in
          the early computer days.
        </p>

          'The difficulty of industry and technology in the past and present is

          needs of profit.'
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly my thoughts on this particular subsection: ‘Ken Colstad, a
          member of the project, described its aims in a 1975 issue of the
          People's Computer Company thus: "Such a horizontal system would allow
          the public to take advantage of the huge and largely untapped
          reservoir of skills and resources that resides with the people. . .
          [It would] counteract the tendencies toward fragmentation and
          isolation so visible in today's society.’
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, while social media and the internet has connected so
          many people from all over the world, cultivating empathy towards many
          different cultures and communities, it has also hyper-injected the
          fragmented and isolated people with the vitriol needed to radicalize
          and mobilize hate.

            It is always to entertaining read old writings that muse and
            hypothesise future technology – even more enlightening when some
            points made are (seemly) accidentally, but right on the money. The
            bulk of the paper explores the current and near future (of that
            time) status of data and the handling and processing of it. The way
            it is the heart of technology and progressing human research.
            Paragraph after paragraph unravelling what is, essentially at the
            core of information technology. It was always about the recording,
            storage, organization, transmission, analysis and communication of
            data. The heart of computer science. There are so many instances
            where the author is close to embodying a technological Nostradamus
            -almost- with the ‘memex’ recalling a type of early iPhone
            prototype.
          </p>
          <p>
            The piece is taken from Atlantic’s 2018’s collection of iconic
            articles over the 160 years of the Atlantic’s publication. It is
            definitely an important and predictive piece of writing produced at
            such an iconic moment in time. After the second world war came to a
            close and all of the death and destruction, helped largely by the
            technological advancements of the time, paused for a moment. The
            author contemplates a peaceful wish in the first paragraph… The hope
            that the next generation of technological advancement is towards the
            betterment of the human race – and there has been aspects of that.
            However, much like the original purpose of many technologies at the
            time that were then weaponized, data sciences and computer sciences
            have also seen their usefulness weaponized and wielded to pit human
            against human. The simple bases of that technology - to organize,
            store and transmit data in the quickest, most effective and
            efficient methods possible have breed both the best and the worst in
            society.
