          If you would like to explore the current 'living' composition and play
          with the sonic space, giddy-up! It's over here. Each 'living
          composition' is composed using sounds that represent quarentine and
          distanced community.
        </p>
        <h3>We are a community even when we are seperated by screens.</h3>
        <p>
          As you interact, you will not only hear the sounds of the time, but
          read small micro stories from people all over the world, which will
          appear on screen depending on the soundscape state...

          Join the process! Send a 15-30 second sound clip - raw recording,
          instrument playing or composed - along with a 3 sentance story
          embodying your own quarentine experience.
