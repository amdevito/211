  <h1>Who Are They?</h1>
<p>AM (Alana) DeVito is a non-binary, Montreal-based, composer, sound designer, musician,
      and interdisciplinary artist. Their career as a touring and studio
      musician spans well over 10 years, multiple countries and numerous
      instruments, and has now expanded into new forms and new collaborations in
      digital arts, film scoring, and art installations. In creative A/V
      installations, compositions and performances, the weaving of ‘virtual
      kinetic’ soundscapes through vibrant, textural worlds take center stage
      while unique, sonic architecture project sweeping narratives. Creative
      computing intertwines with immersive environments while blurring the line
      between the aural and visual sonic space. </p>
