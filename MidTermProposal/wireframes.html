        If you would like to explore the current 'living' composition and play
        with the sonic space, giddy-up! It's over here. Each 'living
        composition' is composed using sounds that represent quarentine and
        distanced community.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you interact, you will not only hear the sounds of the time, but
        read small micro stories from people all over the world, which will
        appear on screen depending on the soundscape state...
